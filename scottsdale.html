                    <p>You basically want to stay as close to Old Town as possible. Scottsdale is tall and skinny on the map and the further north the more affluent the neighborhood. Bachelor parties are going to run through the Entertainment District of Old Town, so being close to there for easy Ubers is a must! If your crew desires a big house with a pool you may have to go 10-20 mins outside of this area to the Northeast in neighborhoods such as Scottsdale Highlands or Scottsdale Monterey</p>
