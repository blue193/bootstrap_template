It’s no wonder Charleston has become one of the most popular Bachelor & Bachelorette Party destinations in the country. The entire region has something to offer - the beaches of South Carolina, the Golf Courses of Kiawah, and the awesome party scene of King Street</div>

                    <div class="name2">Golf</div>
                    <div class="more">Charleston is close to one of the country’s biggest golf meccas of Kiawah Island. This can be a bit of a drive from downtown Charleston, so if your trip is full of golf nuts we at Flock can make sure to taylor the trip so it is all based on getting the most out of Charleston area’s golf. But if your in Charleston to party there are still some great golf options if the boys want to spend on day out on the course:</div>
                    <b>Best Options:</b>
                    <div class="more"><a href='https://kiawahresort.com/golf/the-ocean-course/' target="_blank">Ocean Course</a> on Kiawah former and future host of the PGA Championship, The Ocean Course is consistently rated as one of the top 10 public courses in the United States. This is guaranteed to be one of the most beautiful courses you’ve ever played as you can see the ocean from just about every hole. This is a pricey round and ~1 hour from downtown, but worth it for any golf lovers.</div>
                    <div class="more"><a href='https://www.patriotspointlinks.com' target="_blank">Patriot Point</a> Links is 15 minutes from downtown and is perfect for a day time round with crew. The course is very well maintained for being a public track and having such favorable rates. Hope in an uber from the hotel or airbnb and crack some beers on the course - it’s guaranteed to be a good start to a bachelor party day.</div>
                    <div class="more"><a href='https://www.destinationhotels.com/wild-dunes' target="_blank">Wild Dunes</a> on the Isle of Palms is a happy medium between the short trip and good prices of Patriot Point and the golf mecca of the Ocean Course. Located about 30 mins from downtown, this resort has two Tom Fazio courses and is the perfect place to play a day of 36 with the crew before a big night on King Street</div>

                      <b>Folly beach</b>
                      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/t8F8Oeb.png" class="blog-image-inline">
                      <p>Folly Beach is a 20 minute uber ride from downtown Charleston and the perfect way to spend the day if the crew doesn’t want to golf. This huge stretch of beautiful South Carolina beach is packed with party-ers every Friday and Saturday. There are great bars and restaurants up and down Ashley Ave & Artic Ave. You can’t go wrong drinking all day in Folly Beach before a night out on King St. We highly recommend the day party scene at <a href='https://www.blufollybeach.com' target="_blank">Blu Beach Bar & Grill</a> on Saturday.</p>
                      <b>King Street</b>
                      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/KROaY9m.png" class="blog-image-inline">
                      <p>Spending a Friday or Saturday exploring roaming around King Street is all that’s required for a great bachelor party. Endless bars and great restaurants line the streets. You can find plenty of live music, outdoor spots, rooftop bars, sports bars, and more. Sometimes it’s best not to over plan these things - just go hit the bars all day and night in this you’ll have a good time. Try to find some good rooftop bars as these tend to be a big hit Charleston - some popular ones are <a href='https://www.thevendue.com/charleston-dining/the-rooftop/' target="_blank">Vendue</a> & <a href='https://www.marketpavilion.com/pavilionfood.cfm' target="_blank">Pavillion</a>. We detail some other top spots below in this guide</p>

                      <b>South Carolina Football Game</b>
                      <p>We at Flock always recommend a big time college football game on the Saturday of a bachelor party if at all possible. USC, located in Columbia about a 2 hour drive north from downtown Charleston, is worth the trip. Take a party bus out there and tailgate all day, hit the game and some bars, and head back to party into the night on King Street. Flock can help schedule it all and get you the perfect tickets. All you have to do is enjoy.</p>

                      <p>As we mentioned above, you don’t need much direction when your wandering around the King St drinking. But here are a few spots that are worth bopping into if the crew happens to meander by.</p>
                      <p><a href='https://www.uptownsocialchs.com' target="_blank">Uptown Social</a> - It is impossible to have a bad time at Uptown Social. Live DJs, great drinks, great atmosphere, outdoor space, delicious pizzas and other foods. This place is an absolute must at some point during your Charleston Bachelor Party</p>
                      <p><a href='https://www.thecocktailclubcharleston.com' target="_blank">Cocktail Club</a> - Tucked away on Charleston’s bustling upper King Street, above The Macintosh, The Cocktail Club is an upscale lounge dedicated to the art of the craft cocktail.

Charleston isn’t known for clubbing but this place does not disappoint at all. There is also an awesome outdoor space to enjoy the daily live DJ.

                      <p><a href='http://starsrestaurant.com' target="_blank">Stars Rooftop & Grill Room</a>  -  if the boys want to have a civilized dinner this is the spot, but with an awesome rooftop bar as well.

                    <div class="name2">Where to stay</div>
                    <div class="more">
                      <p>The basic idea is Charleston is to be as close to King St. in downtown as possible. Ideally the crew is at an Airbnb stumbling distance from the bars and there is a lot of good inventory for that in Charleston. It’s easy to find some sweet condos or townhomes that sleep 10. Some even have pools or cool outdoor areas. As long as the crew stays south of Spring St, you are pretty much guaranteed to be happy with where you stay.</p>
                      <p>There are plenty of great hotel options in downtown Charleston right near the action of King Street. Depending on your price range, Flock will help you book the perfect one for your crew (most likely with a rooftop pool).</p>
                      <p>If you don’t want to stay downtown then there are some great other options in the Charleston area:</p>
                      <p><b>Folly Beach</b> - as mentioned above, Folly Beach is a can’t miss spot with an awesome food and drinking scene. There are more airbnb options here or you can always go with one of the cheap hotels</p>
                      <p><b>Sullivan's Island</b> - about 30 min from downtown, Sullivan’s Island has beautiful stretches of beach and some solid food and drinking options, though it’s not going to be as much of a party scene as downtown or Folly Beach.</p>
                      <p><b>Isle of Palms</b> - A little nicer than Sullivan’s Island, the crew can find some awesome Airbnb inventory on the Isle of Palms. There are also some very nice resorts like Wild Dunes with great golf options. Isle of Palms proves to be cheaper but just as nice as the famous Kiawah Island.</p>
