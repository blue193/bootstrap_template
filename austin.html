                    <b>Lake Austin Party</b>
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/P3JwrGP.png" class="blog-image-inline">
                    <div class="more"><p>Head out to Lake Austin and rent a boat to experience one of the best boat party scenes imaginable. Every Friday and Saturday you’ll find the lake packed with party barges full of Bachelor & Bachelorette parties. Lake Austin is 15-20 mins from town and there is also Lake Travis which is closer to a 45 minute trip. Flock can help you book the perfect boat/party barge rental for your crew - there are a number of different services but <a href='https://www.lakeaustinpartyboatrentals.com' target="_blank">Lake Austin Party Boat Rentals</a> is one of the best</p></b></div>
                    <h2>Lazy River Floating</h2>
                    <div class="more"><p>Austin heat can get pretty close to unbearable in the middle of summer - a great way to fight it is cruising down the lazy river in a tube.This is the perfect way to spend a day in Austin. There are a number of options ranging from 30 minutes to an hour away.</p></div>
                    <div class="more"><a href='https://atxcursions.com' target="_blank">ATXcursions</a> is the highest rated tubing set up in the area. Price ranges from $60 - $80 depending on time and day of the week. BYOB and they provide coolers and ice for the perfect day. Best part, they will pick you up and drop you off in downtown Austin.</p></div>
                    <b>Barton Springs</b>
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/k5Op7Mu.png" class="blog-image-inline">
                    <div class="more"><p>Barton Springs is a really cool public swim area just outside of downtown Austin. On a hot Texas summer day there is no better way to work off a hangover then jumping into Barton Springs. Head over for a swim, check out some girls, get rejuvenated for the day ahead before you start the party up again.</p></div>
                    <b>UT Football Game</b>
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gYa8krI.png" class="blog-image-inline">
                    <div class="more"><p>If your bachelor party is between September and December, we highly recommend you book on a weekend that the University of Texas has a home game. Not many big and desirable cities offer top notch college football, but Austin does. Darrell K Royal - Texas Memorial Stadium is just a short Uber ride from downtown. Game day will be one of the best parties you’ve ever been to - hit one of many packed bars or tailgates to have a day. Tickets can be cheap depending on seats and the opponent - make sure you buy in advance if it is a rivalry game</p></div>

                  <div class="more">
                    <p>Austin boasts some of the best outdoor bars in America. Hit Rainey or 6th during the day to play some lawn games in an awesome atmosphere. Most of these spots are great for nightlife as well but head there during the day to fill your day of drinking with some fun games. You can’t really go wrong with any of the outdoor bars in Austin but here are some top recommendations:</p></div>

                    <p><a href='http://austincontainerbar.com' target="_blank">Container Bar</a> is an awesome spot on Rainey built completely out of tanker containers.

                  <div class="more">
                    <p>Some say the Austin beer scene is second to none. The city is lined with beer gardens and breweries to warm the hearts and soles of your crew. Most spots include Food Trucks or good food as well, what else do you need for some day drinking? Here are some of our recommendations:</p></div>
                    <b>Best Options:</b>
                    <p> <a href='https://www.zilkerbeer.com' target="_blank">Zilker Brewing</a> - Right on 6th St, Zilker Brewing is one of the most underrated breweries in Austin. It’s impossible to go wrong with any of Zilkers brews - plus the cool taproom features <a href='https://www.wemovechickens.com' target="_blank">Spicy Boys Chicken</a> as well</p>
                    <p><a href='https://www.hopsandgrain.com' target="_blank">Hops & Grain</a> is a great brewery option on the east side of town. H&P has awesome taproom to put down some pints. The LAZER SALAD beer is routinely a huge hit, along with the rotating Food Trucks from Friday 5-9pm, Saturday 2-8pm, & Sunday 2-7pm.</p>

              <div class="col-sm-6 mb-6 text-left">
                  <div class="name2">Where to party</div>
                  <div class="more">
                    <p>Austin isn’t a top bachelor & bachelorette party destination for no reason - the night-life is awesome. 6th Street and Rainey Street are the top destinations but there are a bunch of hidden gems across the city as well. We’ve laid out some recommendations below for Live Music, go-to bars, and clubs if the crew wants to go bottle service:</p></div>
                    <b>Live Music</b>
                    <p>It’s hard to find a bar in Austin without live music - but if you want to go to a proper concert then check out these venues</p>
                    <p><a href='https://www.stubbsaustin.com' target="_blank">Stubb's</a>- Make sure you check out the lineup at Stubb’s before you get into town. This low key outdoor concert venue (with a BBQ restaurant attached) is a legendary Austin spot. Awesome bands routinely rip through Stubb’s, and it’s right by 6th street to hit the bars before and after the show.</p>
                    <p> <a href='https://cedarstreetaustin.com' target="_blank">Cedar Street</a> is another Austin staple for live music as well. This spot has a great location near 6th street as well.</p>
                    <b>Clubs</b>
                    <p>You don’t come to Austin to go clubbing, but if you want that bottle service feeling than  <a href='http://www.theranchaustin.com' target="_blank">The Ranch</a> is your best option. Right in the heart of 6th Street, this club is half indoors/half outdoors and guaranteed to be packed every night. Bottle Service is probably worth it - it’d a good bargain and can help you get past the long line. Let Flock set it up for you and crew!</p>
                    <b>Bars</b>
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FpeFPFd.png" class="blog-image-inline">
                    <p>As mentioned, there are endless bars to have a good in Austin. Wander up and down Rainey or 6th Street and it shouldn’t be tough to find a good spot. Here are some recs:</p>
                    <b>Best Options:</b>
                    <p><a href='https://www.bangersaustin.com' target="_blank">Banger's</a> on Rainy Street is a can’t miss. Great casual spot for dinner (delicious and famous sausages), live music, and beer/cocktails on the awesome outdoor patio. This spot also features a popular boozy brunch scene on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
                    <p><a href='https://www.thewhitehorseaustin.com' target="_blank">The White Horse</a> is a good ol’ fashioned honky tonk on Dirty 6th. This place is always packed full of fun loving people two stepping to some incredible live music and also has a great back patio. Check it out for that country feel</p>
                    <p><a href='http://www.thedogwoodaustin.com' target="_blank">The Dogwood</a> is a good mix between low key Austin and a club. Right across the street from the Ranch, Dogwood is a smaller spot with awesome indoor/outdoor space (a DJ inside and love music out). Guaranteed to be packed on a weekend night.</p>

                  <div class="more">
                    <p>One word, three letters: BBQ. Austin boasts some of the best BBQ in the country and a trip to this gem of a city isn’t worth it if you don’t scarf down some great BBQ. The Austin food scene doesn’t stop there however - there are some great options for breakfast, lunch and dinner that the crew will love. Also, if you’re into Food Trucks than this city is for you. We’ve laid out some great recommendations below for breakfast, dinner, and some late night spots when the crew needs to grub out:</p></div>
                    <b>Breakfast</b>
                    <p>Staying near Rainey/in East Austin? Look no further than Cenote. Breakfast Tacos and Breakfast Sandwiches that help feed the soul on a tough morning.</p>
                    <p>24 Diner - good ol’ fashioned diner that serves breakfast 24 hours a day (so remember this one as a late night food option as well). Located on West 6th, there’s not much more you can ask for on a hungover morning.</p>
                    <p>As mentioned above, Banger’s is an awesome bar on Rainey street but might be an even better boozy brunch spot. Hit some breakfast beers with some top notch food - this is a can’t miss to get the day going.</p>
                    <b>BBQ & More</b>
                    <p>As with any big BBQ city - the “best” spot is an age-old debate. That being said, <a href='https://www.terryblacksbbq.com' target="_blank">Terry Black’s BBQ</a> is always in the running. Just south of downtown over the Colorado River, Terry Black’s is can’t miss BBQ. Expect a long line but it moves quick. Cafeteria style BBQ with all the fixings, plenty of seating, and a lot of beers - this is the perfect place to grub out before the night out</p>
                    <p>If you want to stay downtown then <a href='https://www.labarbecue.com' target="_blank">la Barbecue</a> is the spot. Great outdoor seating and incredible BBQ. Whether you’re going for lunch or dinner, get here about an hour/hour and half early and expect a long line. But don’t worry - you can enjoy free beer and live bluegrass music while you wait</p>
                    <p>If you’re not gonna do BBQ then you have to get some Tex/Mex while you’re in Austin. Look no further than <a href='https://www.lichascantina.com' target="_blank">Licha's Cantina</a>. This old converted house turned bar/restaurant has some legendary mexican food and awesome outdoor seating. Margs and tacos from here can get the crew rolling for the night of day</p>
                    <b>Late Night Food</b>
                    <p><a href='https://www.happychicks.com' target="_blank">Happy Chicks</a> - this chicken tender spot is a can’t miss. Endless dipping sauces for delicious fries and tenders is all you need after a night out. Open until 2 am on Thursday, Friday, & Saturday</p>
                    <p>Late night pizza is a must on a bach party and if you’re out on Rainey Street than look no further than <a href='http://www.via313.com' target="_blank">via313</a>. Detroit style crispy square slices until 2 am is exactly what the crew the needs. If you’re staying in an Airbnb south of downtown then make sure you go to More Home Slice - great late night za until 3 am.</p>
                    <p>Late late night? <a href='http://www.las-cazuelas-mexican.com' target="_blank">Las Cazuelas</a> is Mexican place opened for 24 hours Wednesday through Sunday. It’s by no means the best food you’ve ever had, but its food at 4 am.</p>

          <div class="row mb-12">
              <div class="col-sm-6 mb-6 text-left">
                  <div class="name2">Where to stay</div>
                  <div class="more">
                    <p>Austin works for both Airbnb/VRBO or hotel for your bachelor party.</p></div>
                    <b>Hotels</b>
                    <p>The best deals on hotels will be located downtown and require a walk/cab to 6th or Rainey. However, a number of hotels has great roof deck pools that are only open to guests and can have a great party atmosphere on a hotel Texas Friday or Saturday. The JW Marriot and The Westin Austin are two of the best options where you can get good bang for your buck (~$200/night depending on the weekend)</p>
                    <b>AirBnb/VRBO</b>
                    <p>Given that Austin has become such a popular destination for bachelor/bachelorette parties there is increasingly more and more great options for alternative stay. Try to find a house with a pool for those hot Austin days - luckily there are a lot! Austin also has another great trait - there are plenty of great neighborhoods to stay in. Here are some of the best neighborhoods to stay in</p>
                    <b>Neighborhoods</b>
                    <p><b>Warehouse & Market Districts</b> - This is right in the thick of it on West 6th Street. If the crew can find a condo or townhome here then you guys are golden. Walk everywhere you need to hit tons of top restaurants and bars on West 6th. Rainey Street is just a short Uber away. Inventory is a little tough to find.</p>
                    <p><b>Rainey Street Historic District/East Caesar Chavez</b> - Just a short walk from Rainey Street is an awesome residential area with great options for Airbnbs/VRBOs. Same as Warehouse & Market Districts, you could walk around the whole weekend and be fine but may need a few Ubers to get across town</p>
                    <p><b>Zilker/Bouldin</b> - Though these two neighborhoods are located south of the Colorado river and require an Uber to downtown, they are great options to stay. Tons of Airbnbs/VRBOs with pools and cheaper than downtown. You can also walk to some cool bars, breweries and Barton Springs. It’s just a short Uber into Rainey or 6th</p>

                    <p>As mentioned above, Banger’s is an awesome bar on Rainey street but might be an even better boozy brunch spot. Hit some breakfast beers with some top notch food - this is a can’t miss to get the day going.</p>
                    <b>BBQ & More</b>
                    <p>As with any big BBQ city - the “best” spot is an age-old debate.
