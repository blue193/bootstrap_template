                        an awesome atmosphere and some of the country’s best live country music. <br><br>

                    <div class="more"><p>One of the coolest parts of downtown Nashville is the close proximity of the city’s two major sports teams’ stadiums. The NFL’s Tennessee Titans play just over the Cumberland River at Nissan Stadium - a short walk from the main strip of bars on Broadway. If your crew is in town for a long weekend and the Titans are in town, there isn’t a better way to spend the day on Sunday. Bridgestone Arena is home to the NHL’s Nashville Predators. The arena is right in the thick of it on Broadway and Preds fans are known to be some of the best in hockey. Taking in the game can be a great way to get loose before the bars.</p></div>

                        <p>Looking for a way to spend the day around Nashville before a big night on Broadway? Try out a few breweries. Nashville is home to awesome craft breweries that are walkable or just short uber rides away from one another. Just a short walk South from Broadway area is Pie Town, where 3 craft breweries (and one moonshine distillery) are all within walking distance. Enjoy some great beers and food in the following order, finishing up at Ole Smoky Distillery/Yee-Haw Brewing Co. where there is outdoor games, live music, and food trucks:</p>

                    <p>Top Golf has become one of the best ways to spend the day during the bachelor party. Nashville’s location is perfect - a short uber across the river. Spend the day with buckets of beers and some not-so-friendly competition before the night gets going on Broadway.</p></div>

                  <div class="more">
                    <p>You don’t need much direction when your wandering around the Broadway drinking. But here are a few spots that are worth bopping into if the crew happens to meander by:</p></div>
                    <p><a href='#' target="_blank">FGL House</a>- Right off Broadway on 3rd Avenue, Florida Georgia Line House is a can’t miss. Each floor has a big bar and plenty of TVs to watch the game and throw down some beers. There is also a great menu and the largest rooftop Nashville has to offer, dedicated to an all-day and all-night party. There is also a basement-level lounge for late night.</p>
                    <p><a href='#' target="_blank">Old Red</a> is Blake Shelton’s bar right on Broadway. Just like most places in the area - it’s got awesome live music and good food. Not much more you can ask for.</p>
                    <img src="./image/nashville/old-red.png" class="blog-image-inline">
                    <p><a href='#' target="_blank">Whiskey Row</a>- similar to what you’ll find in Scottsdale, Whiskey Row goes from a great place to drink beers and watch football at 1 PM to an all out Country Club at 1 AM. There is no problem with posting up here in the afternoon and staying until closing - just let Flock hook you up with a good table for when it gets packed.</p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="name2">Breakfast</div>
                  <div class="more">
                    <p><a href='#' target="_blank">Puckett's Grocery & Restaurant</a>is right downtown and is a can’t miss. Full breakfast menus featuring classics to help soak up the hangover like delicious Breakfast Burrito. Or you can go with the buffet to try it all out.</p></div>
                    <p>Since it opened up in 2015, <a href='#' target="_blank">Biscuit Love</a> has become a Nashville staple. They’ve since opened 3 more locations. If you want a fried chicken and egg sandwich on the most delicious biscuit you’ve ever had then look no further. If your Airbnb or Hotel is near the Gulch (not far from downtown) this is a can’t miss.</p>
                    <p>Traditional and delicious diner right on Broadway - say no more. <a href='#' target="_blank">Sun Diner</a> will not let you down, especially if you order the Chicken & Waffles. Look no further for the perfect way to kick off the day and fight your hangover.</p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="more">
                    <p><a href='#' target="_blank">Acme</a>is a can’t miss spot right at the end of Broadway overlooking the river. Live music, a great atmosphere, and a beautiful rooftop bar - we can’t recommend this spot enough. The crew can head there for dinner and there is a good chance you won’t leave until they kick you out.</p>
                    <p>If you go to the South you have to get BBQ atleast once. Look no further than <a href='#' target="_blank">Martin's BBQ</a> Joint on 4th. This is a short walk from downtown it will not disappoint. There is also a great outdoor area for some beers and of course some top notch live music.</p>
                    <p>You can’t go wrong with <a href='#' target="_blank">Stillery</a>. Great food and brick oven pizza’s to share right on Broadway before a night out in the bars. If you’re looking for something simple but checks all the boxes, head here. Oh and yes - there is live music</p>

                    <p><a href='#' target="_blank">The Diner</a> is open 24/7 and serves alcohol all night. It’s a short walk from the bars on broadway. Breakfast, lunch and dinner — no matter the hour, what else could you ask for? A diner with 6 floors? Oh yeah, you can have that too. The first floor is coffee shop perfect for grab ‘n’ go items, while the sixth floor is often the most lively.</p>

                    <p>Nashville has endless great VRBO/Airbnba short walk from the action of Broadway Street. It’s possible to find some gems with roofdeck, pools, and hot tub to keep the party going after the bars. Flock will help make sure you land the accommodations that is perfect for your crew</p>
                    <p> If the crew isn’t feeling the Airbnb route, there are some great hotels close to the action as well. If you go with a hotel, you might as well choose one that has a pool. The <a href='#' target="_blank">Westin</a>, <a href='#' target="_blank">Omni</a>, and <a href='#' target="_blank">Kimpton</a> all have some rocking pool party scenes while being close to all the bars.</p>
