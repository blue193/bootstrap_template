                    <p>Miami Beach is known for its high-end and stylish hotels. The best restaurants, bars, and clubs all tend to be in a hotels - which makes easy for a bachelor party.

                    <p><a href='#' target="_blank">Fontainebleau</a>: As we mentioned in the pool party section, Fontainebleau is a Miami Beach staple. The location isn’t perfect - it’s a cab right south to the heart of South Beach but Fontainebleau has a top notch pool party, the nightclub LIV, and very nice accomodations.</p>
                    <p><a href='#' target="_blank">Delano</a> is another great option with a perfect location right in the heart of South Beach. With a great pool party as well the Delano is hard to ignore if your crew is going the hotel route.</p>
                    <p><a href='#' target="_blank">Mondarian</a> is a great spot on the west side of the peninsula. Though not right in action of South Beach, Mondarian is a great option just a short cab ride away with an awesome pool and great amenities.</p>
                    <p>Though less common due to the prevalence of great hotels, a VRBO/Airbnb is a great way to go in Miami Beach. There are plenty of great condos available to book right on Ocean Drive in the heart of the beach, restaurants, bars and clubs. There are also a number of great houses in the center of the peninsula with roof decks, pools, etc for those bach parties that want to all be in the same place. Flock will help make sure you land the accommodations that is perfect for your crew</p>

Bachelor parties are going to run through the Entertainment District of Old Town, so being close to there for easy Ubers is a must! If your crew desires a big house with a pool you may have to go 10-20 mins outside of this area to the Northeast in neighborhoods such as Scottsdale Highlands or Scottsdale Monterey</p>
