                    <p>There is nothing quite like Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks around late February to early March depending on the year. Usually there is one major parade each day through the French Quarter and many days have several large parades. Amazingly, this city-wide party does not slow down for the whole time. Though New Orleans is packed with tourists and everything is more exciting, it can be a great time to have you bachelor party. Wander the French Quarter streets with excitement and partying everywhere you look. Just make sure you dress for the occasion and bring some beads</p></div>

                        <p>The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, also known as Jazz Fest, is held the last weekend of April & first weekend of May every year. Jazz Fest is located in the northern part of the city at the Fair Ground Race Course, featuring 10+ music stages, food & beer tents, and more. The celebration isn’t limited to just the fairground however. Similar to Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest turns into a city wide party. Jazz clubs & live music halls all over the city have shows from the afternoon to the wee hours of the morning. If you want to have your bachelor party during Jazz Fest, let Flock help you navigate the city so you know exactly where to be</p>

                  <div class="more">
                    <p>What’s a trip to New Orleans if you don’t explore the bayou for a while? Might as well take the time to go see some gators, or rip around the bayou on an airboat. There are many options for swamp boat or airboat tours and Flock can help find the one that’s perfect for your crew. Most tours are about 2 hours long and range from 45min - 1.5 hrs away from downtown. Some services even pick you up with coolers and ice so you don’t have to worry about a thing, or Flock can set you up with a party bus. It can be a great way to spend kick off the weekend on Friday as the guys get into town or kill some time on Saturday before the party gets going again.</p>
                    <p><strong>Best Option for Swamp Boat Tour</strong>: Cajun Encounters is the way to go for a Swamp Boat tour. Experienced captains guide you through the Honey Island Swamp in nicely kept swamp boats. See some gators up close and personal - these boat captains know exactly where to go. Cajun Encounters will pick you up and drop you off back in New Orleans - all you have to do is pack a cooler!</p>
                    <p><strong>Best Option for Airboat Tour</strong>: If you want to experience the bayou but want something a bit more fast paced then go with Airboat Adventures. Wipe around the swamps in a private boat for the crew and let the fresh air work off the hangover. Airboat Adventures will pick you up from the city as well - let Flock book your tour and you just enjoy</p>

                        <p>Spending a Friday or Saturday exploring around the French Quarter is all that’s required for a great bachelor party. Endless bars and strip clubs line the streets and you can walk around with booze without anyone giving a damn. Most places have live music and the cajun food is can’t miss. Sometimes it’s best not to over plan these things - just go hit the bars all day and night in this lawless land and you’ll have a good time.</p>

                        <p>If you and the crew have never seen a big time college football game then you should seriously consider it for the Saturday of your trip down south. There is nothing quite like SEC football and even more so, there is nothing quite like Death Valley, home of the LSU Tigers. Baton Rouge is a 1.5 - 2 hour drive from downtown New Orleans. Take a party bus out there and tailgate all day, hit the game and some bars, and head back to party into the night in French Quarter. Flock can help schedule it all and get you the perfect tickets</p>

                        <p>As we mentioned above, you don’t need much direction when your wandering around the French Quarter drinking. But here are a few spots that are worth bopping into if the crew happens to meander by:</p>
                        
                        <p><a href='#' target="_blank">Beerfest</a> is right in the heart of the French Quarter and will not let you and the crew down. Its a bar with stools and about six dozen beers on tap. No food, no thrills, just a great place to sit down, crush beers and watch the game. Perfect way to get the day or night going.</p>
                        <p><a href='#' target="_blank">Pat O'Brien's Bar</a> is a rollicking piano lounge, a beer hall decorated with beer steins, and an outside courtyard with live music all rolled into one. There's live music daily. Hurricanes, mint juleps and bloody marys are the most popular drinks, and there's a menu of burgers, classic Creole dishes and alligator bites. It won’t let you down.</p>
                        <p><a href='#' target="_blank">The Penthouse Club</a> is the most popular gentleman’s club in the French Quarter. Not much explanation needed here either, but it feels worth mentioning that we would not recommend popping into just any stripe club in the French Quarter as quality is paramount - The Penthouse Club won’t let you down in that regard.</p>

Though the Ruby Slipper has multiple locations around town, it’s best to hit up the Mid City original for a morning meal of fried chicken. Served over a biscuit and topped with poached eggs, it will kill a hangover. Delicious Bloody Mary’s will get the day going.</p>
                    <p><a href='#' target="_blank">Jimmy J’s Cafe</a> - Simple but perfect. Let’s not over-complicate breakfast for a crew of hungover dudes.

                    <p><a href='#' target="_blank">Bar Redux</a> - If you’re staying in the Bywater then this should be your last stop before pass out time. The beloved neighborhood watering hole has not only a great bar menu that serves late it also has eclectic music, an outdoor patio, and A burlesque schedule.

                    <p><a href='#' target="_blank">13 Monaghan</a> - bar and restaurant that slings top notch drunk-food (an entire section of the menu is devoted to the various forms of nacho/tater tots mash-ups). Open until 4 am every night - it also serves breakfast all day. </p>
                    <p><a href='#' target="_blank">Cafe Du Monde (Famous Beignets)</a> - This iconic French Quarter cafe is open 24/7, and a beignet or three is a great way to soak up the alcohol. This spot is packed with tourists all day long but it’s a different story late night after the bars close down.</p>
                    <p><a href='#' target="_blank">Dat Dog</a> - Dat Dog until 3 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights serving delicious hot dogs and fries. Simple as that but it will not let you down.</p>

If you want to go Airbnb route, will make sure we find a place that fits your needs. If not the French Quarter, we would recommend a neighborhood close by - go for either Marigny/Bywater (north of the French Quarter) or the Garden District (south of the French Quarter)</p>
